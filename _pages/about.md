Welcome! I am an astronomer at [Steward
Observatory](https://www.as.arizona.edu/), [University of
Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/) and a member of the JWST/MIRI Science Team.
I study supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and galaxies across the cosmic time
with a focus on their infrared properties. 

How do SMBH influence galaxy formation and evolution? What
are the mechanisms behind their growth and interactions with surrounding matter?
Unravelling the mysteries of SMBHs and their relationship
with galaxies is essential for advancing our understanding of the Universe's
past, present and future. However, the existence of large amount of dust
greatly shapes the observed properties and makes the systems obscured. Right
now, we even do not have a complete picture of the growing phase of SMBHs, also
known as the active galactic nuclei (AGN) phenomenon. 

Unlike many astronomers who have been annoyed by dust, I take advantage of its
IR emission to search and characterize AGN and their host systems with the
combination of various data and techniques across the electromagnetic spectrum.
This includes multi-wavelength diagnostics from deep X-ray, optical, IR and
radio surveys to search for obscured AGNs across cosmic time, comparative
spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of the unresolved multi-band
UV-to-submm photometry measurements of low-z objects and high-z ones to obtain
insights on the AGN dusty environment, optical to near-IR time variability and
dust reverberation mapping to probe the very inner structures of the AGN torus.
I also conduct morphological study, optical--to--mid-IR integral field unit
(IFU), and UV to mid-IR spectroscopic observations of AGN and galaxies near and
far with various ground- and space-based telescopes. Sometimes I even do
numerical simulations and run complicated models to explain the observations on
supercomputers. You can learn more in the [research](/research) page.

I have been interested in astronomy since I was a child and I still enjoy
stargazing every once in a while. In particular, I conduct astrophotography and
chase solar eclipses. Besides watching the sky, I am also a fun of drawing &
painting (both paper and digital), running (marathon races included), anime and
sci-fi.
