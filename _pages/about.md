Welcome! I am an astronomer at [Steward
Observatory](https://www.as.arizona.edu/), [University of
Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/). I study supermassive black holes (SMBH) and
galaxies across the cosmic time with a focus on their infrared properties. 

How do supermassive black holes influence galaxy formation and evolution? What
are the mechanisms behind their growth and interactions with surrounding matter?
Unravelling the mysteries of supermassive black holes and their relationship
with galaxies is essential for advancing our understanding of the Universe's
past, present and future. However, the existence of large amount of dust
greatly shapes the observed properties and makes the systems obscured. Right
now, we even do not have a complete picture of the growing phase of SMBHs, also
known as the active galactic nuclei (AGN) phenomenon. 

Unlike many astronomers who have been annoyed by dust, I take advantage of its
IR emission to search and characterize AGN and their host systems with a wide
range of data and techniques across the electromagnetic spectrum. This includes
spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of the unresolved multi-band
UV-to-submm photometry measurements, UV to mid-IR spectral observations with
both ground- and space-based telescopes, morphological study and
optical--to--mid-IR integral field unit (IFU) observations, optical to near-IR
dust reverberation mapping, multi-wavelength diagnostics from X-ray to the
radio band to search for AGN signature, numerical simulations of dust radiative
transfer models on supercomputers. You can learn more in the
[research](/research) page.

I have been interested in astronomy since I was a child and I still enjoy
stargazing every once in a while. In particular, I conduct astrophotography and
chase solar eclipses. I am also a fun of drawing & painting (both paper and
digital), running (marathon races included), anime and sci-fi.
