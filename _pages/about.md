Welcome! I am an astronomer at [Steward Observatory](https://www.as.arizona.edu/), [University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/). I study supermassive black holes and galaxies across the cosmic time with a focus on their infrared properties. 



To study these objects, I use a wide range of data and techniques across the electromagnetic spectrum. You can learn more in the [research](/research) page.

I have been interested in astronomy since I was a child and I still enjoy stargazing every once in a while. In particular, I conduct astrophotography and chase solar eclipses. I am also a fun of drawing & painting (both paper and digital), running (marathon races included), anime and sci-fi. 

 * [CV](), [publications]() (to be updated occasionally); see [astro-ph arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=1&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=jianwei+lyu&terms-0-field=author&classification-physics=y&classification-physics_archives=astro-ph&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=all_dates&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date&abstracts=show&size=50&order=-announced_date_first) for most recent papers.
