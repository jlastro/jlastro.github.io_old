Welcome! I am an Assistant Research Professor at [Steward Observatory](https://www.as.arizona.edu/), [University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/). I study the dusty side of supermassive black holes and galaxies across the cosmic time. 

I got my Ph.D in astronomy and astrophysics from University of Aizona in 2020.
